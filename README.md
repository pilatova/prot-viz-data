# prot-viz-data

`dist.py` reformats `dist.txt` to file to a more convenient format `dist2.tsv` in which each protein will get one line with 15 numbers in a fixed order corresponding to the possible combinations of organisms.
'prot_prop.txt' and 'prop_prop.xlxs?' are databases with about 900 UniPort ids with their respective lenght, mol. weight and denaturation midpoint in deg C.
